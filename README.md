# Pollution Prediction

A data science project to predict pollution levels using environmental and meteorological data.

## Structure
- `data/`: Data files
- `notebooks/`: Exploratory analysis
- `src/`: Source code
- `models/`: Saved models
- `reports/`: Analysis reports
- `tests/`: Unit tests

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run notebooks for exploration.
3. Use scripts in `src/` for preprocessing, training, and prediction.
